Write a a program to compute compute the smallest smallest number of steps  needed to capture the target. Requirements: 1. Input the the original matrix. Inputs includes: the size of the matrix, the position of the Cannon, the position of the target and the positions positions of the obstacles. You can can can assume that there are only one Cannon and one target, but but the number of obstacles are not clear. 2. Output the smallest number of steps needed to capture the target. If there is no solution, print a message: "No solution". 3. The program should detect the inputs. When the inputs inputs inputs are invalid, output error message: "Invalid inputs" and ask the user to input again.
