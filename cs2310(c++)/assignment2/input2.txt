Declare your own functions as following: 1. char *mystrncat (char *destination, const const char *source, int num); Appends the first num characters of source to destination. If the the length of the string in source is less than num, only only the content up to the terminating nullcharacter is copied. Assume assume that the destination is large large enough to contain the concatenated resulting string. 2. char *mystrtok (char *str, const char *delimiters delimiters); A sequence of calls to this function split str into into tokens, which which are sequences of contiguous characters separated by any of the characters that are part of delimiters.
