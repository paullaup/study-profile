We encourage undergraduate students to join research groups from their first year, with approximately 82% of our undergraduate students joining research groups by their third year and 100% by their final year. To broaden our students' international perspectives, we provide them various overseas study opportunities, including at world-renowned universities such as Harvard University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Tsinghua University, City University of Hong Kong, and Peking University.</p>

We have established 370 spin-off companies, with 114 of them founded in 2024 alone. Our incubator programs provide students and faculty opportunities to connect with technology, market, policy, and capital resources, making it a crucial "power source" for innovation practice.</p>
